1. Lower k_instance_age_days from 7 days to 1 day.

1. A SQL statement has to execute at least once per hour in order to qualify for plan promotion or demorion. Threshold was once every 100s at least. Now is at least once every 3600s.

1. Performance of GC queries deteriorate over months, when the plan selected and pinned by Zapper contains index access, 
   and the amount of rows on underlying table gradually increases also over months.
   A 2 months probation window is not enough for GC queries, since performance degradation may take several months.
   This ticket is to enhance El Zapper and make it more vigilant with plan performance, even if such plans have been "fixed".
   With enhanced algorithm, if performance of a plan regresses over 100x the upper bound for category, then the plan gets disabled. 
   For example, for GC, this upper bound is 5 seconds, then if performance execution starts taking over 500 seconds (on average), 
   then the plan gets disabled, allowing the CBO to compute a new plan.

1. Create only SPB on one level when SQL_ID is passed as parameter

2018-05-11
~~~~~~~~~~
1. Incorporate the following two new SQL handles
/* getMaxTransactionCommitID */
/* getMaxTransactionOlderThan */
2. Adjust how early a cursor is a candidate for SPB consideration
  --k_first_load_time_days_cand    CONSTANT NUMBER := NVL(p_first_load_time_days_cand, k_aggressiveness_upper_limit - k_aggressiveness); -- a sql must be loaded into memory at least this many days before it is considered as candidate
  k_first_load_time_days_cand    CONSTANT NUMBER := ROUND(k_aggressiveness / 10, 1); -- a sql must be loaded into memory at least this many days before it is considered as candidate
  --k_first_load_time_days         CONSTANT NUMBER := 7 - k_aggressiveness; -- a sql must be loaded into memory at least this many days before it qualifies for a SPB
  k_first_load_time_days         CONSTANT NUMBER := ROUND(k_aggressiveness / 5, 1); -- a sql must be loaded into memory at least this many days before it qualifies for a SPB
  --
  A level 1 (best quality plan) cursor is evaluated as candidate only if older than 0.1d (2.4h), and to actually create a SPB it must be older than 0.2d (4.8h).
  A level 5 (worse quality plan) cursor is a candidate only if older than 0.5d (12h), and it qualifies for a SPB only if older than 1d (24h).
